Datasets that could be useful for civic problems and/or with WPRDC datasets

## Datasets that pair well with WPRDC datasets

[American Local Government Elections Database](https://osf.io/mv5e6/)
* Potentially useful for: Comparing Pittsburgh/Allegheny County local elections with other local elections across the country.
* Goes with the [WPRDC dataset on Allegheny County Elections Results](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/election-results).
* From the abstract: "The study of urban and local politics in the United States has long been hindered by a lack of centralized sources of election data. We introduce a new dataset of about 78,000 candidates in 57,000 electoral contests that encompasses races for seven distinct local political offices in most medium and large cities and counties in the U.S. over the last three decades. This is the most comprehensive publicly-available source of information on local elections across the country. We provide partisan and demographic information about candidates in these races as well as electoral outcomes. This new dataset will facilitate a myriad of new research on representation and elections in local governments."
* The core file ([`ledb_candidatelevel.csv`](https://osf.io/tbwzd)) file has all the elections results in it. It includes Pittsburgh and Allegheny County results for local offices (mayor, city council, county executive, county legislature, sheriff, and prosector).

## Datasets that are fun

[Pinball Map](https://pinballmap.com/map?address=pittsburgh%2C+pa) - A crowdsourced map of locations of pinball machines.
* There is an [API](https://pinballmap.com/api/v1/docs) and [permission to use API results with attribution and a backlink](https://pinballmap.com/faq#1).
